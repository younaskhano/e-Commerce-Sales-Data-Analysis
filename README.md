# e-Commerce (Target) Sales Data Analysis

This repository contains an in-depth analysis of the e-Commerce sales data provided by Target. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/devarajv88/target-dataset?select=products.csv). The dataset includes customer, order, product, payment, and seller information.

In this project, I used MySQL to solve various client questions, ranging from basic to advanced queries, designed to extract meaningful insights from the dataset.

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains the following files (accessible via the Kaggle link):

- `customers.csv`: Information about the customers including unique IDs and locations.
- `geolocation.csv`: Geographical data of customer locations.
- `order_items.csv`: Details about the individual items in each order, including prices and product IDs.
- `orders.csv`: Information about the orders, including order status, timestamps, and customer IDs.
- `payments.csv`: Details of payment methods and payment amounts.
- `products.csv`: Information about the products, including category and product prices.
- `sellers.csv`: Information about the sellers, including seller IDs and locations.

## Client Questions

### Basic Queries
1. **List all unique cities where customers are located.**
2. **Count the number of orders placed in 2017.**
3. **Find the total sales per category.**
4. **Calculate the percentage of orders that were paid in installments.**
5. **Count the number of customers from each state.**

### Intermediate Queries
1. **Calculate the number of orders per month in 2018.**
2. **Find the average number of products per order, grouped by customer city.**
3. **Calculate the percentage of total revenue contributed by each product category.**
4. **Identify the correlation between product price and the number of times a product has been purchased.**
5. **Calculate the total revenue generated by each seller, and rank them by revenue.**

### Advanced Queries
1. **Calculate the moving average of order values for each customer over their order history.**
2. **Calculate the cumulative sales per month for each year.**
3. **Calculate the year-over-year growth rate of total sales.**
4. **Identify the top 3 customers who spent the most money in each year.**
